## good habits for avoiding bugs

- maintain good code structure
- follow good coding principles/best practices
  - don't use global variables
- run your code frequently as you write bits
- run it as you go
- keep it simple
- comment your code
- use meaningful variable and method names
- use autocomplete/atom shortcuts
- verify your understanding with print/puts statements
- boundary conditions
  - e.g. first and last elements of arrays
  - first and last iterations of loops
- test individual methods/modules as you write them
- try things out in the console (e.g. irb)

## strategies for dealing with bugs

- read the error message
- googling the error message
- ask for help
- read your code
- test pieces of code individually
- print statements
  - print values of variables, methods return values
  - print "hello" to learn if a line is executing
- work backwards through the logic/mentally walk through the code
- talk through the problem with someone else
  - "rubber duck debugging"
